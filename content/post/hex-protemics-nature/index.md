We are excited to share that our work "AI-enabled virtual spatial proteomics from histopathology for interpretable biomarker discovery in lung cancer" has been published in **Nature Medicine**.

HEX is an AI model designed to computationally generate spatial proteomics profiles from standard histopathology slides. It enables high-resolution mapping of protein expression and can transform our understanding of biology and disease.
